Min Freq - The random frequency won't be less than this value
Freq Range - Min Freq + Freq Range equals the maximum frequency possible
Beat - the interval in 1/n of a bar. 1 is a full bar. 2 is half a bar, 16 is a 16th note, etc.

The filter is customizable for both channels. Filter Type, Gain , and Q value is selected by the user for L and R audio channels
